This past weekend I visited Princeton campus to attend HackPrinceton, a hackathon hosted by the university.
Out of the 10+ hackathons iv went to I feel this was one of the best hackathon experiences iv had. 
Everything from the sleeping arrangements to the overall structure and layout of the hackathon felt well organized.

I attended this hackathon with two of my coworkers and one new friend I met at Princeton. We spent a week trying to
come up with ideas before the hackathon began and ultimatly settled on creating the "Photo-Orb". This would be a device
capable of circling a human or an object and taking a 360 degree portrait of it. All 360 cameras take an outward facing 
image so we wanted to make an inward facing solution. 

There were three components to this project: assembling the hardware, programming the hardware,
and programming a webpage to take many images and stitch them together.

Other than the project, I spent a lot of time playing around with a 3D printer and printing everything I could think of.
Some things I printed out were: a Jeep logo, a Pontiac logo, a coin with the Bitcoin logo on it and the totem from the movie
Inception.
