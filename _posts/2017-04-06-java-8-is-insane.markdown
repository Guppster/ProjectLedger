Everyone who has programmed with me knows I really enjoy writing Java. It might
be because it was the first "real" programming language I learned back in highschool 
or because iv memorized so much of it. Regardless of that though, the additions 
featured in Java 8 have greatly evolved the language and transformed it into 
something completely new!

Recently a had been getting bored of using Java at my job and started to push to
write tools in a different language, but now that iv discovered Java 8 streams,
lamba expressions, and more I can't wait to use more Java.

In this post I will discuss some features of JDK8 and show examples of how to use them.

Here is a list of things added
* Lamda Expressions
* Changes to Generic Types
* Stream Collections
* Functional Interfaces
* Small changes to Reflection and Annotations
