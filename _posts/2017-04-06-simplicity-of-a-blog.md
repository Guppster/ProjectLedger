I have wanted to make a blog for some time now but always decided not to because I couldn't
find a simple, efficient, and productive technology stack to support it. I looked into the 
usual: medium, wordpress, wix, etc and found them all to be too heavy weight for my application.
What I really wanted was a simple blog with no comments, no share buttons, no special formatting.
Just text and images with no distractions.
