I have wanted to make a blog for some time now but always decided not to because I couldn't
find a simple, efficient, and productive technology stack to support it. I looked into the 
usual: medium, wordpress, wix, etc and found them all to be too heavy weight for my application.
What I really wanted was a simple blog with no comments, no share buttons, no special formatting.
Just text and images with no distractions.

One online blogging system I really like is [Medium](http://www.medium.com). I think Medium has really eye catching blog posts
due to the way the words are placed and the fonts that are used. I think these features have greatly 
contributed to the success of Medium in the past few years. The style of my blog is very similar to 
Medium, except it doesn't have any extra social media style functions.
