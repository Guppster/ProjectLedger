I have wanted to make a blog for some time now but always decided not to
because I couldn't find a simple, efficient, and productive technology stack to
support it. I looked into the usual: medium, wordpress, wix, etc and found them
all to be too heavy weight for my application.  What I really wanted was a
simple blog with no comments, no share buttons, no special formatting.  Just
text and images with no distractions.

One online blogging system I really like is [Medium](http://www.medium.com). I
think Medium has really eye catching blog posts due to the way the words are
placed and the fonts that are used. I think these features have greatly
contributed to the success of Medium in the past few years. The style of my
blog is very similar to Medium, except it doesn't have any extra social media
style functions.

A major goal I set for this blog was to minimize the amount of non-content
related links on the page. I use vim bindings in my browser to navigate
webpages instead of using the mouse so when a page has too many links it
becomes really annoying to use.  On this blog if you try exposing the links,
there will be very few that are not directly related to the article. This keeps
vim linking very simple and easy to follow.
