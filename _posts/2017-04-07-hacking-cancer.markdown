[HackingCancer](https://github.com/Guppster/HackingCancer) is an attempt to
create a challenging web applet game in Java with the main purpose of utilizing
the power of crowdsourcing to improve cancer research.

This is a Side-Scroller, platformer game in which the user first creates their
own map from visual representations of a Gene MicroArray. The user is
challenged to determine the path with the most amount of orbs present which
would allow them to collect these orbs in the second stage of the game. 

This path is a unautomatable process due to sher amount of data and thus is the
bottleneck for scientists in their progression to find a cure for cancer.
Allowing users to solve these simple problems has been statistically proven to
increase analysis speed by 600% (Jonna Reynolds, Cancer Research UK).

Once the map has been created, the user is placed at the starting point on
their own map. The map is populated with many monsters that will kill the user
if they touch them to make the game challenging and competitive. Upon reaching
the finish line the user is shown their score and the score + the extracted
research data is saved online in JSON format for further analysis. 

My partner, Konrad Pfundner, and I programmed this project in under 36 hours 
at HackWestern 2015 and recieved and were awarded as one of the top finalist
at the event.

For further analysis take a look at the [code on
Github](https://github.com/Guppster/HackingCancer).
