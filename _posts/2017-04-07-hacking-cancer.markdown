<a href="https://github.com/Guppster/HackingCancer" target="_blank">HackingCancer</a> is an attempt to 
create a challenging web applet game in Java with the main purpose of utilizing
the power of crowd sourcing to improve cancer research.

This is a side-scroller, platform game in which the user first creates their
own map from visual representations of a Gene Micro-Array. The user is
challenged to determine the path with the most amount of orbs present which
would allow them to collect these orbs in the second stage of the game. 

This path is not an automatable process due to the sheer amount of data involved and
thus is the bottleneck for scientists in their progression to find a cure for
cancer.  Allowing users to solve these simple problems has been statistically
proven to increase analysis speed by 600% (Jonna Reynolds, Cancer Research UK).

Once the map has been created, the user is placed at the starting point on
their own map. The map is populated with many monsters that will kill the user
if they touch them to make the game challenging and competitive. Upon reaching
the finish line the user is shown their score and the extracted
research data is saved online in JSON format for further analysis. 

My partner, Konrad Pfundner, and I programmed this project in under 36 hours at
HackWestern 2015 and were awarded as one of the top finalist at the event. Our
goal for this hackathon was to attempt something challenging and really improve
our programming skills. To achieve this level of difficulty we refrained from
using any external libraries or frameworks to make game development easier
and programmed everything using basic java graphics and processing. This
decision turned out to be very rewarding as I ended up learning a lot about
drawing and manipulating shapes in java.

HackWestern 2015 was also my first time presenting a hackathon project on stage
by myself. I had been awake for 36 hours and didn't have any time to prepare so
it was quite an interesting experience. I was surprised that we made it
to the finals because we spent the first night of the hackathon trying to hack
the internal display system of a Tesla... that was fun, but didn't work out
very well. 

While thinking of ideas we were trying to make something that would cause a
social impact because that was one of the sponsor prizes and we like to win.
We ended up qualifying for the following list of prizes on <a href="https://hackwestern.devpost.com/submissions/35020-hackingcancer" target="_blank">DevPost</a>:

* Most Creative App 
* Best Use of Mashape APIs 
* Best Use of AI 
* Best Domain Name Registered 
* Best Social Impact Hack
