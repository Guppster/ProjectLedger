Everyday I run into poorly written code and spend lots of my time reformatting
it; therefore, i'm creating this style guide as something i can quickly
reference when starting a project with a new team. Follow this guide, and
everything will be great. Some things in this guide will be only applicable to
java but most points will work in the majority of languages. 

#### Spacing

Your lines of code should be adiqutely spaced out. Only lines that are directly
related to eachother should be touching eachother.
