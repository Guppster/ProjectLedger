In this article I'll be documenting the process of choosing and constructing hardware to use for my ARK Lock project.

## What is ARK Lock?
The ARK-Lock project is an effort to use the [ARK blockchain](Ark.io) to manage a smart deadbolt lock. To see some explanation in to why this is being attempted and high level design visit the [ARK-Lock Design](ark-lock-project) article.

## Major Hardware Required

- Processing Unit: Raspberry Pi / Arduino

- Hardware to support RFID

- Hardware to support WIFI

- Physical deadbolt and door assembly

- Servo to control deadbolt mechanism

- Enclosure for Lock
