Awesome lists are curated lists containing everything awesome about a specific
subject. You can find a large list of them here:
https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome

I recently discovered this large collection of awesome lists and I think every
developer should be aware of it. They greatly reduce the amount of time
required researching and discovering libraries to use in new projects. 

To give back to this great collection of information I decided to create my own
awesome list for a platform I am passionate about, the ARK blockchain.
I realized that without a list like this new platforms suffer from developers
recreating pre-existing libraries because they just cant find them. Awesome
lists also simplify the process for the open source community because they can
easily see which libraries exist and which ones they could help create.

I hope to create a pull request and add my list to the offical collection of
awesome lists after the awesome-ark repo has time to mature.
