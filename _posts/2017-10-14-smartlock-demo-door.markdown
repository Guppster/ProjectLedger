This article will cover my creation of a demo door to show off my smart lock.
We're going to start with a piece of wood and an old deadbolt lock and turn
them into a masterpiece.

_The Final Product_

## Materials

- 2 x 8 piece of wood
- 3D printed electronics housing 
- Deadbolt lock
- Paint (Optional)
- Servo

### Step 1

Obtain a piece of 2 x 8 wood and use a guide to cut holes for the deadbolt.

### Step 2 

Test fit the deadbolt lock to ensure everything fits.
If it doesn't cut a new piece of wood and try again.

_It fits!_

### Step 3

Sand down the wood with 80 grit sandpaper to prep it for paint and get rid of rough edges

### Step 4

Get some cheap paint and spray it down.

### Step 5

In this step we will prepare the deadbolt so it will fit well with the 3D printed servo housing

You can get the 3D printing files from here: [Add link to thingiverse (NFC Servo housing)]

As you can see, the rod coming out of the locking mechanism needs to fit tightly in the servo connector.
This may be different in your case but for me the rod was too thick to fit inside the connector. To fix 
this issue I grinded down a small amount of the rod until it would fit. As a last resort the rod can also 
be connected with glue.

### Step 6

Attach the locking mechanism of the lock on one side of the finished demo door and the housing connector 3D printed piece
on the other side. The deadbolt rod should be positioned in the middle of the printed piece.

Then attach the rotating servo connector to the deadbolt rod. You are now ready to connect a servo to this and control your lock.

### Step 7

Putting it all together now. Put the servo in the large circular housing and your control board inside the rectangular box at the bottom.
