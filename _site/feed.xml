        <title>Java 8 is INSANE</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone who has programmed with me knows I really enjoy writing Java. It might
be because it was the first “real” programming language I learned back in highschool 
or because iv memorized so much of it. Regardless of that though, the additions 
featured in Java 8 have greatly evolved the language and transformed it into 
something completely new!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently a had been getting bored of using Java at my job and started to push to
write tools in a different language, but now that iv discovered Java 8 streams,
lamba expressions, and more I can’t wait to use more Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I will discuss some features of JDK8 and show examples of how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of things added&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lamda Expressions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes to Generic Types&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stream Collections&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Functional Interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small changes to Reflection and Annotations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Simplicity of a Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to make a blog for some time now but always decided not to because I couldn’t
find a simple, efficient, and productive technology stack to support it. I looked into the 
usual: medium, wordpress, wix, etc and found them all to be too heavy weight for my application.
What I really wanted was a simple blog with no comments, no share buttons, no special formatting.
Just text and images with no distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One online blogging system I really like is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. I think Medium has really eye catching blog posts
due to the way the words are placed and the fonts that are used. I think these features have greatly 
contributed to the success of Medium in the past few years. The style of my blog is very similar to 
Medium, except it doesnt have any extra social media style functions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HackPrinceton 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I visited Princeton campus to attend HackPrinceton, a hackathon hosted by the university.
Out of the 10+ hackathons iv went to I feel this was one of the best hackathon experiences iv had. 
Everything from the sleeping arrangements to the overall structure and layout of the hackathon felt well organized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;amp-img width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;558&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/resize_Princeton-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended this hackathon with two of my coworkers and one new friend I met at Princeton. We spent a week trying to
come up with ideas before the hackathon began and ultimatly settled on creating the “Photo-Orb”. This would be a device
capable of circling a human or an object and taking a 360 degree portrait of it. All 360 cameras take an outward facing 
image so we wanted to make an inward facing solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three components to this project: assembling the hardware, programming the hardware,
and programming a webpage to take many images and stitch them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the project, I spent a lot of time playing around with a 3D printer and printing everything I could think of.
Some things I printed out were: a Jeep logo, a Pontiac logo, a coin with the Bitcoin logo on it and the totem from the movie
Inception.&lt;/p&gt;
