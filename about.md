My name is Gurpreet Singh. I'm a software engineer by day and a car enthusiast
by night. I enjoy learning new programming languages, being paranoid about internet 
privacy, and working on classic cars in my free time.

I started this blog as a way to document the many technical projects I work on 
and provide some tutorials regarding topics I have experience with. I feel that
teaching a topic greatly helps me develop a better understanding of it myself and 
therefore would also like this blog to serve as an exercise in thought organization.

Following this blog would be benefital to people who are interested in upcoming 
programming languages or technologies, following the progress of car rebulids, 
and improving themselves as a developer. I plan this blog to closely follow
and document my projects on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/Guppster). Further expanding on their readme's and 
providing interesting examples
