My name is Gurpreet Singh. I'm a software engineer by day and a car enthusiast
by night. I enjoy learning new programming languages, being paranoid about internet 
privacy, and working on classic cars in my free time. I study computer science and
software engineering at the University of Western Ontario and will graduate in 2018.

I started this blog as a way to document the many technical projects I work on 
and provide some tutorials regarding topics I have experience with. I feel that
teaching a topic greatly helps me develop a better understanding of it myself and 
therefore would also like this blog to serve as an exercise in thought organization.

Following this blog would be benefital to people who are interested in upcoming 
programming languages or technologies, following the progress of car rebulids, 
and crypto-currencies as investments or development platforms. I plan this 
blog to closely follow and document my projects on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/Guppster). Further expanding 
on their readme's and providing interesting examples. 

For people who do not know, [GitHub](http://www.github.com) is a website were you can store git repositories
which you can use for collaboration, version control and packaging your projects.
GitHub is one of my favourate websites and I am usually pushing code multiple times 
a day. My goal for this year is to have my commit count consistantly above 1000 commits. 

If you would like to communicate with me remember to encrypt all communications with
the public key provided on my homepage and send me an email.
